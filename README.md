# Welcome to the hyperion space app repository!

## Branches 

### Main branch 
This is just a collection of useful scripts and utilities to help us parse CSV files, run a test flask server, and generate HTML file code.

### 3-flask branch 
This is a simple webapp that we created to browse the archived data provided by NASA from both the moon and mars. This allows the user to search the files by date efficiently. 

### mseed branch
This is a branch where we utilize DSP filters such as lowpass and bandpass to filter traces taken from mseed files. Then we apply the classic sta/lta algorithms, adjusting as needed
until an arrival wave is found.
